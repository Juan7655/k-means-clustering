# K-Means Clustering

This is the implementation of the k-means clustering algorithm. This project has been tested with pyhon3.6; other python versions may not work.

It should be enough with the configuration from the Main.py file as to include/exclude graphs, visualizations, setting different cluster numbers, etc.
